i had a way then losing it all on my own i had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown and im not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat and im not keeping now the strength i need to push me
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone you shine it when im alone and so i tell myself that ill be strong and dreaming when theyre gone
cause theyre calling calling calling me home calling calling calling home you show the lights that stop me turn to stone you shine it when im alone home
noises i play within my head touch my own skin and hope that im still breathing and i think back to when my brother and my sister slept in an unlocked place the only time i feel safe
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone you shine it when im alone and so i tell myself that ill be strong and dreaming when theyre gone
cause theyre calling calling calling me home calling calling calling home you show the lights that stop me turn to stone you shine it when im alone home
lights lights lights lights lights lights lights lights (home home) lights lights lights lights lights lights
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone you shine it when im alone and so i tell myself that ill be strong and dreaming when theyre gone
cause theyre calling calling calling me home calling calling calling home you show the lights that stop me turn to stone you shine it when im alone home
